# Student Career ETH Hardhat Project

This simple university project uses Hardhat@2.22.18 which use deprecated modules. This version
was used for simplicty and using the examples during class. Chai and Ethers.js was used to make tests.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/StudentCareer.ts
```
